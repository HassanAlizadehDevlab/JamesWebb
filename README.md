# James Webb App (Kotlin)
The name of the project derived from James Webb Space Telescope

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build android application from the ground up using Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern.


The goal is to showcaseobject oriented programming by kotlin, including:

- Reactive programming with [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/2.x) and [RxAndroid 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid/tree/2.x)
- Dependency injection with [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
- Networking with [Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- Persisting with [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
- Androis stuffs: [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html), [AppCompat](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/packages.html#v7-appcompat), [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), ... 
- Writing code usgin [Clean Architecture]() principles and [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (MVVM) pattern
